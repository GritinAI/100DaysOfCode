## Always make sure you code along each of the Resources and solve out Challenges 

## Challenge Write a Python Code that and takes in more than one input(n) and performs a Mathematical Operation to print out the FInal Result 

#### test if input = 5,6,7 operation is plus = 18

### Hint your input should be stored in a List wrapped in a while loop and once the user enter Ok and the Sign it does the operation
